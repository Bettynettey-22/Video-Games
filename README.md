# RECOMMENDATIONS. 
- Prioritize game development for PS2, X360, PS3, Wii, and emerging successors.
- Consider genres that repeatedly show success such as Platformers, Action, Shooter, and Sports.
- Customize marketing strategies by region:
- Promote Pokémon and family-oriented titles more in Japan.
- Leverage FPS and sports games in North America.
- Push soccer (FIFA) and open-world games (GTA) in Europe.
- Study Nintendo and EA’s portfolio because they consistently top charts.
- Smaller publishers should explore partnerships or adopt proven models from successful titles.
- Since 2007–2010 saw spikes in average game sales, we can consider analysing economic, technological, or cultural factors from that period to guide future release windows.
